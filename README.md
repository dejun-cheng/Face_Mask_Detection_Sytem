# Face Mask Detection Sytem
In order to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, a soft-computing based face mask detection system is proposed and designed to ensure an individual wear face mask in public area. The system is expected to detect masked and unmasked individual through image and real-time live video stream. By using this system, authorities can detect unmasked individual and perform necessary actions such as disallow the entry or issue compound to the individual.
